# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java-JavaFX
🎮 Developed a JavaFX-based Tic Tac Toe Game! 🎮

🌟 Sleek Design: The game features a clean and user-friendly design, making it easy to play and enjoy.

👥 Multiplayer Fun: Challenge your friends or family to a friendly match. The game takes care of tracking player turns.

🎉 Victory Celebrations: Celebrate your wins with a victory dialogue that pops up when you win.

🤝 Tie Games: The game even recognizes when it's a tie and lets you know.

🏆 Score Tracking: Track your victories with a scoring system for Player X and Player O.

👩‍💻 Developers Note: The code is well-documented and cleanly organized for anyone interested in exploring the JavaFX framework or improving their coding skills.

💡 I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot about JavaFX in the process. If you'd like to try it out or take a peek at the code, feel free to reach out.
